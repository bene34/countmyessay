# countmyessay
Input specific parameters regarding your essay requirements to a form, and it will tell you how many words you need to write.

The inspiration for the app comes from a college project. I had limited time to complete an essay and was not given how many words I needed to write, but simply how many pages I needed to write amongst a few other parameters such as font size. 

The app is built using a REACT front-end and node.js backend. OpenAI API is used.
